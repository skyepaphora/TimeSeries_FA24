# Homework 1

Submit your work as a Quarto document to [Crowdmark](https://app.crowdmark.com/courses/stat-464-864-discrete-time-series-analysis-f24). (You will most likely have to upload individual pages of the pdf.)

### Notes
I decided to lean heavily into the Super Mario Galaxy motif, for fun. Copyright Nintendo. Everything you need to know is explained on the first couple of pages.


### Versions
The COOL version of this assignment is the one called [Room_1.pdf](https://github.com/skyepaphora/TimeSeries_FA24/blob/main/Homework/Room_1.pdf)

The less cool (but more legible and also free of copyrighted imagery, hence its use on Crowdmark) version is the one called [Homework_1](https://github.com/skyepaphora/TimeSeries_FA24/blob/main/Homework/Homework_1.pdf). It also has some extra white space in case you want to write on the pdf directly.
