# Proposal
Gotta be a Quarto PDF.

#### Your Dataset
Go online and find some time series dataset of a reasonable size. 
It should be at least 50 observations long, but not so long that it slows down RStudio.
(I like working with datasets in the low thousands, myself)

1.  Where did you find this dataset? 
(Btw: if you don't know where to start, check out [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)).
2.  What are the variables of interest? What are you modelling with respect to time?
3.  Describe any other attributes of the data that you think may be relevant.
Will you have to "clean" the dataset, at all?

#### Plotting
Demonstrate that you can load and plot the data, 
according to the regular "Plotting Etiquette" you've used in Rooms 1-3.

#### Motivation
1.  Why are you interested in this dataset? What are you trying to learn?
2.  Do you have any hypotheses about what you will find when you model the data?
3.  If the data supports your hypothesis, what are the implications? What do we learn?

#### Methodology
1.  Do you anticipate modelling some trend, for this data, 
using Classical Time Series modelling techniques? Which ones?
2.  Do you plan on modelling any seasonal components? How many?
3.  How will you incorporate ARMA(p,q) modelling into your analysis?
4.  What are your forecasting plans? How long do you plan to forecast into the future?
