## Workshop Agenda

This is the one workshop that won't involve much math, this semester. It also may be one of the most difficult, I'm afraid. We will focus on getting everyone's software running smoothly, and will go over how to produce the documents you will be handing in throughout the course. It's important to motivate *why* I'm making you jump through these hoops. 

#### Learning Outcomes
1. Creating and rendering **Quarto** files
2. Basic **Markdown** skills, including how to format homework problems
3. Coding **chunks**
4. Understanding **dynamic output**
5. Using **working directories** and/or R projects
6. Including **image files** (you'll do this for handwritten proofs)
7. Importing **data**
