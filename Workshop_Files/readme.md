2. Create meaningful scientific **plots** for time series data
3. **Eliminate trends** using 
    - polynomial regression 
    - MA smoothing
    - exponential smoothing
4. **Estimate seasonal components** using
    - harmonic regression
    - ITSMR's `season()` function
5. Identify significant lag-$h$ **Autocorrelation** of deseasonalized residuals
