## Workshop Agenda

#### Brief review of exponential smoothing
We went very quickly through the expansion of an exponential smoother at the end of Friday's class. Let's revisit that, and discuss what exponential smoothing actually *is.*

#### MA smoother revisited
Also on Friday: I tried to throw together an MA smoother on the fly for demonstration purposes in R, but I kinda bugged out. So I've put together a version of what I was *trying* to do in the `Workshop_1` folder. We'll glance at it before the real workshop begins.

#### Real Workshop
This is the one workshop that won't involve much math, this semester. It also may be one of the most difficult, I'm afraid. We will focus on getting everyone's software running smoothly, and will go over how to produce the documents you will be handing in throughout the course. It's important to motivate *why* I'm making you jump through these hoops. 

#### Learning Outcomes
1. Creating and rendering **Quarto** files
2. Basic **Markdown** skills, including how to format homework problems
3. Coding **chunks**
4. Understanding **dynamic output**
5. Using **working directories** and/or R projects
6. Including **image files** (you'll do this for handwritten proofs)
7. Importing **data**
