### Software Guides

You may need help installing the computing software required for this course. Here are a couple of guides.

>[Guide for Windows](https://github.com/skyepaphora/TimeSeries_FA24/blob/main/SoftwareGuide_Windows.md)\
>[Guide for Mac](https://github.com/skyepaphora/TimeSeries_FA24/blob/main/SoftwareGuide_Mac.md)

These guides were mostly written by some of my profs/colleagues at Trent University. *They also made videos! <3* These videos are available on OnQ, HERE. You may find these particularly helpful if you have a Mac.
