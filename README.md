<!--- ## Software Guides

**Warning: some information in these guides may be out of date. Expect updates over the next week or so.**

You may need help installing the computing software required for this course. Here are a couple of guides.

>[Guide for Windows](https://github.com/skyepaphora/TimeSeries_FA24/blob/main/Guides/SoftwareGuide_Windows.md)\
>[Guide for Mac](https://github.com/skyepaphora/TimeSeries_FA24/blob/main/Guides/SoftwareGuide_Mac.md)

These guides were mostly written by some of my profs/colleagues at Trent University. *They also made videos!* These will be available some time this week, hopefully. You may find these videos particularly helpful if you have a Mac. --->
